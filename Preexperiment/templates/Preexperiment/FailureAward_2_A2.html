              CleverClean Inc. grants Courage Awards to managers who <strong>have the courage to “pull the plug“ of a failing project before more resources are wasted and are not afraid to admit their failures</strong>.

                <p><Strong><i>How do you, as a leading project manager, qualify to receive a Courage Award</i>?</Strong></p>
                <p>In case you take value adding risks but your project ends up failing, you can be certain to receive a Courage Award if you deliberately decide for project discontinuation. If you decide to discontinue your project at a later point of time, you still have the chance to earn a Courage Award. However, in case of delayed project discontinuation, a Courage Award is only granted with a 50% chance.</p><hr>
            
                <p><Strong><i>How does CleverClean Inc. define a failing project</i>?</Strong></p>
                <p>A project is defined as failing if investing any additional dollar in this project creates lower expected returns than investing in alternative projects.</p><hr>
                
                <p><Strong><i>Besides the reward ceremony, what exactly do you receive as a Courage Award</i>?</Strong></p>
                <p>CleverClean Inc. has allocated a total budget of 0.2 million Lira for its Courage Awards. Each Courage Award is worth 1% of the 0.2 million Lira budget.</p>
