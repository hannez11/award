                          <p>In this experiment, you are taking on the role of a leading project manager at the company <i>CleverClean Inc.</i></p>
                          <p>In order to generate further growth within the next years, the management board intends to launch a new household utensil.<strong> Since you are the manager of the projects department, the board instructs you to choose and manage one out of two potential innovation projects.</strong> At <i>CleverClean Inc.</i> projects are selected based on their expected return. Hence, projects with higher expected returns are preferred.</p><hr>
                          Further, as part of <i>CleverClean's</i> corporate strategy, the board especially puts emphasis on the following aspects:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Achievement of high customer and employee satisfaction at any time</li>	
                            <li>Encouragement of employees to be innovative</li>	
                            <li>Reduction of resource wastage in failing projects</li> 	
                          </ul>
                          <p>As financing capacities are limited, a project is considered as failing if <strong>investing any additional dollar in this project creates lower expected returns than investing in alternative projects</strong>.</p><hr>
                          <p>You will receive information about the two project ideas after completing the quiz. Based on this information, you will have to decide which of the two projects <i>CleverClean Inc.</i> should invest in. Once you have decided on one of the two projects, it will be launched. After you selected one project, you have to make up to <strong>two follow-up decisions</strong> whether you want to continue your project.</p><hr>
                          <h5>Important</h5>
                          <p>Please be aware that your decisions might be <strong>reviewed by the experimental administrator</strong>. In this case you will receive written feedback on your decisions after you finished the experiment.</p>

                          <p>During the main task, project related data is reported in the experimental currency <i>Lira</i>. Correspondingly, your compensation is first determined in the experimental currency <i>Lira</i> and will be converted into Dollar at the end of the experiment. 10,000 Lira is equivalent to one Dollar.</p><hr>
                          <p>Your total compensation consists of the following three components:</p>

                          <h5>1. Lottery payment</h5>
                          <p>You will receive information about your lottery payout at the end of the experiment.</p>
                          
                          <h5>2. Fixed payment</h5>
                          <p>At the end of the experiment you will receive <strong>a fixed payment of XX Lira</strong>.</p>
                          
                          <h5>3. Variable payment</h5>
                          <p>The variable compensation is based on the project's outcome, which is affected by your decisions during the main task.</p>
                          <p>The project's outcome is calculated as follows:</p>
                          <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                            <li><strong>Project outcome = Cash inflows - Required investment</strong></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>At the end of the experiment you receive a variable compensation, which equals 1% of the project's outcome. Additionally, you have the chance to receive a reward which will be explained on the next page. Thus, the variable compensation is calculated as follows:</p>
                          <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                            <li><strong>Variable compensation in Lira = (Project outcome + potential award) × 1%</strong></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>At the end of the experiment you receive detailed information on your compensation.</p>
                          <hr>
                          
                          <h5>Example for the variable compensation:</h5>
                          <ul>
                          <li>The required investment of a project is 2m Lira.</li> 
                          <li>The project's expected future cash inflows amount to 7m Lira.</li>	
                          <li>The project realizes cash inflows of 7m Lira. Thus, the project outcome is 5m Lira.</li>
                          <li>Additionally, you qualify to receive the award which amounts to 0.2m Lira.</li> 	
                          <p></p>
                        </ul>
                          <p>Your variable compensation is 1% of the project outcome plus the award, which equals to 52,000 Lira.
                          Accordingly, you would receive a variable compensation of $5.20 in this experiment.</p>
