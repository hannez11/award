    <li class="list-group-item">On the next page 15 scenarios are presented. Each scenario shows a safe payment and a lottery with different probabilities of winning. <strong>Your task is to select the scenario in which you would switch from participating in the lottery to the safe payment. </strong></li>
    <li class="list-group-item">At the end of the experiment, 1 of the 15 scenarios will be chosen randomly by the computer. The selected scenario represents the lottery component of your compensation. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp; <strong>If you chose the safe payment</strong> in this selected scenario, you would receive $0.75 for the lottery task. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note the amount of the safe payment is the same for all scenarios. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp; <strong>If you chose to participate in the lottery </strong>  in this selected scenario, it would be drawn whether you <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have won ($1.50) or lost ($0) the lottery. Please note that the probabilities of winning or losing differ <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across the scenarios. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">After you select a scenario, an explanation for each lottery outcome is displayed. Please read it carefully and confirm your choice as soon as you are sure about your decision.</li>
