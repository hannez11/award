                        <p>In this experiment, you are taking on the role of a leading project manager at the company <i>CleverClean Inc.</i> As the leading manager of the projects department, you are particularly responsible for the <strong>selection and implementation of potential innovation projects</strong>.</p><hr>
                        
                        <p>A few months ago, CleverClean Inc. got a new management board. The new board especially puts emphasis on the following aspects: <br>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Achievement of high customer and employee satisfaction at any time</li>	
                          <li>Encouragement of employees to take risks in order to create innovative products</li>	
                          <li>Reduction of resource wastage in failing projects</li> 	
                            
                         </ul>
                          
                          In order to generate further growth within the next years, the board intends to launch a new household utensil.<strong> Since you are the manager of the projects department, the board instructs you to choose and manage one out of two potential innovation projects.</strong> At <i>CleverClean Inc.</i>, projects are selected based on their expected return. Hence, projects with higher expected returns are preferred.</p><hr>
                        
            
                        <p>You will receive information about the project ideas after completing the quiz. Based on    this information, you will have to decide which of the two projects <i>CleverClean Inc.</i> should invest in. Once you have decided on one of the two projects, it will be launched. After you selected one project, you have to make up to <strong>two follow-up decisions</strong> whether you want to continue your project.</p><hr>

                        <p>Please be aware that your decisions might be <strong>reviewed by the experimental administrator</strong>. In this case you will receive written feedback on your decisions after you finished the experiment.</p>

                      <p>As part of <i>CleverClean’s Inc.</i> corporate policy, the company implemented a new type of award for its employees – the <strong>Failure Award</strong>. A newspaper recently published the following article about <i>CleverClean’s Inc.</i> usage of Failure Awards:
                      </p>

                      <hr>
                      <p>The management board is convinced that Failure Awards help <i>CleverClean Inc.</i> to gain a competitive advantage. Thus, Failure Awards will be rewarded to employees who <strong>have the courage to take value adding risks by trying something new and are not afraid to fail big</strong>.</p>

                      <p><Strong><i>How do I, as a leading project manager, qualify to receive a Failure Award</i>?</Strong></p>
                  
                      <p>In case you take value adding risks but your project ends up failing, you can be certain to receive a Failure Award if you deliberately decide for project discontinuation.
                      If you decide to discontinue your project at a later point of time, you still have the chance to earn a Failure Award. However, in case of delayed project discontinuation, a Failure Award is only granted with a 50% chance.</p>

                      <p><Strong><i>How does CleverClean Inc. define a failing project?</i></Strong></p>
                      
                      <p>A Project is definded as failing in case both of these two criteria are met:  <br>
                      <ol>
                        <li>The expected project returns are less than initially predicted</li>	
                        <li>An available alternative project generates more expected value than the current project </li>

                      <p>During the main task, project related data is reported in the experimental currency <i>Lira</i>. Correspondingly, your compensation is first determined in the experimental currency <i>Lira</i> and will be converted into Dollar at the end of the experiment. 10,000 Lira is equivalent to one Dollar.</p><hr>
                      <p>Your total compensation consists of the following three components:</p>
                      
                      <h5>1. Lottery payment</h5>
                      <p>You will receive information about your lottery payout at the end of the experiment.</p>
                      
                      <h5>2. Fixed payment</h5>
                      <p>At the end of the experiment you will receive <strong>a fixed payment of XX Lira</strong>.</p>

                      <h5>3. Variable payment</h5>
                      <p>The variable compensation consists of two parts: 
                        <ol>
                          <li>The major part is based on the balance of the project account, which is affected 	by your decisions during the main task. The current balance of the project account 	amounts to 7.5m Lira.</li>	<p></p>
                          <li>Additionally, depending on your decisions, you have the chance to receive a Failure Award. The company allocates a total budget of 0.2m Lira to Failure Awards. If you qualify to receive a Failure Award, you will receive 1% of the total budget. </li>	
                           </ol>
                      
                      </p>
                      <p>The balance of the project account is calculated as follows:</p>
                      <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                        <li><strong>Project account balance = 7.5m Lira + (expected discounted cash inflows - required investment)</strong></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>At the end of the experiment, you receive a variable compensation, which equals 1% of the balance on your project account plus - <strong>if you qualify</strong> - 1% of the Failure Award budget:</p>
                      <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                        <li>Variable compensation in Lira <strong>without</strong> Failure Award = Project account balance × 1%</li>
                        <li>Variable compensation in Lira <strong>with</strong> Failure Award = (Project account balance + Failure Award) × 1%</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>At the end of this experiment, detailed information on how much money you will receive for participating in this experiment will be displayed.</p>
                      <hr>
                      
                      <h5>Example for the variable compensation:</h5>
                      <ul>
                      <li>You qualify to reiceive a Failure Award with a total budget of 0.2m Lira.</li>	
                      <li>The initial balance of the project account is 7.5m Lira.</li>	
                      <li>The required investment of a project is 3.5m Lira.</li>	
                      <li>The project generates expected discounted cash inflows of 1m Lira.</li> 	
                      <p></p>
                      <li>Thus, the project account balance is 5m Lira (7.5m - 3.5m + 1m = 5m).</li> 	
                      <li>The assessment basis of your compensation is therefore 5.0m Lira from the project plus 0.2m Lira from the Failure Award (=5.2m Lira).</li>
                      <p></p>
                    </ul>
                      <p>Your variable compensation is 1% of this assessment basis, which equals 52,000 Lira.
                      Accordingly, you would receive a variable compensation of $5.20 in this experiment.</p>
