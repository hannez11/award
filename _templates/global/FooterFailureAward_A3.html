        <div class="col-8"> <br>In 2020 Max received a Courage Award for his innovative project of creating a cleaning product for universal usage. Unfortunately, after starting the project it turned out that the overall product won’t be profitable. Max received the Courage Award because of his <b>courage to start a risky and innovative project and because he quickly terminated it in order to prevent that more money is wasted in the project</b>.

                CleverClean Inc. grants Courage Awards to managers who <strong>have the courage to take value adding risks by trying something new and are not afraid to fail big. Additionally, managers should also have the courage to ”pull the plug” of a failing project before more resources are wasted and are not afraid to admit their failures</strong>.

              <p><Strong><i>How do you, as a leading project manager, qualify to receive a Courage Award</i>?</Strong></p>
              <p>In case you take value adding risks but your project ends up failing, you can be certain to receive a Courage Award if you deliberately decide for project discontinuation. If you decide to discontinue your project at a later point of time, you still have the chance to earn a Courage Award. However, in case of delayed project discontinuation, a Courage Award is only granted with a 50% chance.</p><hr>
          
              <p><Strong><i>How does CleverClean Inc. define a failing project</i>?</Strong></p>
              <p>A project is defined as failing if investing any additional dollar in this project creates lower expected returns than investing in alternative projects.</p><hr>
              
              <p><Strong><i>Besides the reward ceremony, what exactly do you receive as a Courage Award</i>?</Strong></p>
              <p>CleverClean Inc. has allocated a total budget of 0.2 million Lira for its Courage Awards. Each Courage Award is worth 1% of the 0.2 million Lira budget.</p>
