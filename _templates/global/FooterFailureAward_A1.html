                <p><Strong><i>How do you, as a leading project manager, qualify to receive a Failure Award</i>?</Strong></p>
                <p>In case you take value adding risks but your project ends up failing, you can be certain to receive a Failure Award if you deliberately decide for project discontinuation. If you decide to discontinue your project at a later point of time, you still have the chance to earn a Failure Award. However, in case of delayed project discontinuation, a Failure Award is only granted with a 50% chance.</p><hr>
            
                <p><Strong><i>How does CleverClean Inc. define a failing project</i>?</Strong></p>
                <p>A project is defined as failing if investing a dollar in this project creates lower expected returns than investing in alternative projects.</p><hr>
                
                <p><Strong><i>Besides the reward ceremony, what exactly do you receive as a Failure Award</i>?</Strong></p>
                <p>CleverClean Inc. has allocated a total budget of 0.2 million Lira for its Failure Awards. Each Failure Award is worth 1% of the 0.2 million Lira budget.</p>
